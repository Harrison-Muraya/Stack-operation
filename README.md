# Stack-operation

Compilation: Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Execution: Run the compiled program and follow the instructions.
Operations:
display(): Shows all values in the stack.
change(): Modifies the value at a specified position in the stack.
peek(): Retrieves the value at a specified position in the stack.
count(): Displays the number of items in the stack.
pop(): Removes and returns the topmost value in the stack.
push(): Adds a value to the stack.
isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
isFull(): Checks if the stack is full.
Code Structure
Stack Class:

Stack(): Constructor initializing the stack.
isEmpty(), isFull(): Check stack conditions.
push(), pop(): Add/remove elements from the stack.
count(), peek(), change(): Access or modify stack elements.
display(): Display all stack elements.
Main Function:

Provides a menu-driven interface to perform stack operations.
Enter the corresponding option to perform a specific operation.
Enter 0 to exit the program.
Usage
Upon running the program, follow the menu prompts to execute stack operations.
Ensure to provide valid inputs for position, value, and operation choices.
Note
The stack implemented here has a fixed size of 5 elements.
Be cautious while performing operations to avoid stack overflow or underflow.
Feel free to use and modify this code as needed!
